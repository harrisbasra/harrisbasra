### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub account! I am a driven and passionate software engineering student at Fast-NUCES university in Lahore, with a focus on developing innovative and high-quality software solutions.
With a strong background in programming languages such as C++, Java, and C#, I have honed my skills in the field and am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge.
Recently, I have been focused on Native Android App Development, and I am eager to delve into the world of Flutter to build cross-platform programs. 
In the past, I have also worked with HTML, CSS, and Photoshop, and while my knowledge in these areas is limited, they have provided me with a strong foundation in design and web development.
When I'm not programming, you can find me listening to music, which is a constant source of inspiration and motivation for me. 
I am always looking for new and exciting projects to work on, and I believe that my passion for programming and love of learning will drive me to achieve great things in my career. 

Thank you for taking the time to visit my GitHub account, and I look forward to sharing my work with you! <3
